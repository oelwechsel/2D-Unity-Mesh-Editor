# 2D-Unity-Mesh-Editor
Unity Editor Skript to create a custom Mesh to use for 2D Pathfinding.

## -- Important --
Place this script inside the `Assets/Editor` folder to ensure that it is only compiled and executed in the Unity Editor, and it will not be included in the final build.

## -- Guidelines --
- Click left mouse button to place a vertex (vertices will connect automatically)
- Hold left mouse button to drag vertex around
- Press backspace to remove last placed vertex
